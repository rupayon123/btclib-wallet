# Runs inside the container the Dockerfile beside this file builds, cwd
# at $SRC/btclib-wallet (the Dockerfile's WORKDIR). $CC, $CXX, $CFLAGS and
# $LIB_FUZZING_ENGINE are ClusterFuzzLite's own, exported before this
# script runs; the install below is what puts them in front of any
# extension a dependency compiles, which is why it has to happen inside
# this container and not in the Dockerfile. uv.lock pins btclib and every
# other runtime dependency; `uv export` reads it into a hashed
# requirements file so `pip3 install --require-hashes` resolves nothing
# of its own from the index, and the project installs `--no-deps` right
# after, its own dependencies already satisfied by that file.
#
# The three-line shape -- install, discover, compile -- is
# docs/build-integration/python_lang.md's own example build.sh for a
# Python project, and google/oss-fuzz's projects/idna/build.sh, a
# pure-Python parser of untrusted input the way this tree's parsers are.

# compile_python_fuzzer forwards every extra argument straight to
# pyinstaller, ahead of the fuzzer's own path (base-builder's own
# compile_python_fuzzer script). --collect-data closes a gap PyInstaller's
# own analysis does not: btclib.curves.curve and btclib.network each read
# a JSON file under their own package's `_data/` directory at import
# time, from a path built off `__file__`, and btclib_wallet.bip44 does
# the same for `_data/bip44_purposes.json` -- a frozen onefile executable
# bundles no non-Python file PyInstaller cannot trace a reference to.
# Both packages are named for every harness, walking each one's whole
# tree rather than naming one `_data/` directory alone, so a harness
# whose own import chain does not reach a given directory today still
# gets it bundled, ahead of the next harness that does.
#
# The same loop also zips each target's own seed corpus, one
# fuzz/corpus/<name>/ directory per fuzzer (google/fuzzing's glossary,
# "Seed Corpus": inputs "checked into source alongside fuzz targets"),
# under the name libFuzzer picks up next to a target's own binary with
# no configuration -- so a new fuzz_*.py with a corpus directory beside
# it is picked up here without a second list of names to keep in step
# with the first.
