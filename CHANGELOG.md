An entry for anything a reader would notice: what changed, and the issue
it answers. That is section 9 of [the organization standard][std], and it
is narrower than "every change" — a comment reworded inside a workflow
changes nothing a reader of this repository meets, and lands without an
entry. [RELEASE_NOTES.md](./RELEASE_NOTES.md) has the release notes,
which say what a user has to act on; this file is the record behind them.

[std]: https://github.com/btclib-org/.github

Neither file states how many entries it holds: a stated number is a line
every open branch has to edit, and the two files carry a union merge
driver that would keep both sides' numbers.

## v2026.10 (work in progress, not released yet)

### `README.md` carries the OpenSSF Best Practices badge

It follows the Scorecard badge, where section 2 of the organization
standard places it for a tree section 10's `scorecard` entry names; the
project is bestpractices.dev's 14813 (issue btclib-org/.github#350).

### A release's version is the date it is cut

`RELEASING.md` dates a release `YYYY.M.D` of the day it is cut, not the
placeholder's month with the day added (closes #5).

### The suite the sdist ships is run from the unpacked sdist

`test.yml`'s `dist` job unpacks the sdist it built and runs the suite
there, gated at 100% coverage (closes #3).

### `sdist-rebuild.yml` stops passing `attest-signer`

The called workflow verifies against `reusable-attest.yml` alone, so the
input decides nothing (issue btclib-org/.github#1315).

### The type aliases only the wallet uses are defined in the wallet

`BIP44ScriptType`, `BlockCipherF`, `EmbeddedScriptType`, `KeyOrder`,
`MnemonicLang` and `ValidSigHashType` are published by this package's own
modules, not imported from `btclib.alias` (issue btclib-org/btclib#2244).

### `input_validation_test.py` checks this package's own aliases too

An alias a public parameter takes, from btclib's `alias.py` or this package,
is driven or exempted with a reason, and the walk drives `Entropy`; `BinStr`
and `Mnemonic` wait on their functions' validation (closes #12, issue #15).

### A mnemonic or a binary-string entropy of another type is refused

The functions taking one refuse any other type with a `BTClibTypeError`,
bytes included, and `input_validation_test.py` drives `BinStr` and
`Mnemonic` (closes #15).

### SLIP-0039's list of shares is refused when it is not one

`master_secret_from_mnemonics` and `mxprv_from_mnemonics` refuse anything
but a sequence of mnemonics, a lone mnemonic included, with a
`BTClibTypeError` (closes #17).

### `codeql-passed` and `test-passed` no longer skip while draft

A skipped required check reads as passing, so both aggregates now fail
a first step on the draft flag instead of skipping on it (issue
btclib-org/.github#1327).

### CPython 3.15 is the interpreter pinned and a version claimed

`.python-version` names 3.15, its release candidate counting as a
release, and the classifiers and the sweeps gain it; `requires-python`
stays at 3.11 (issue btclib-org/.github#1324).

### pre-commit.ci skips `uv-lock`

Its image lacks the interpreter `.python-version` names and has no
network to download it; the lint workflow still runs the hook (issue
btclib-org/.github#1348).

### The rebuild of a release names the interpreter its tag pinned

`RELEASING.md`'s *Rebuild a release from its tag* reads it from the tag's
`.python-version` rather than naming one (issue btclib-org/.github#1349).

### The rebuild of a release runs in a worktree of its tag

`RELEASING.md`'s *Rebuild a release from its tag* builds in a worktree of
the tag, clean by construction, and drops the `git archive` export, which
has no `.git` for its git commands (issue btclib-org/.github#1352).

### A drift line names both commits whole

`check_vendored_vectors.py` prints the pinned commit and upstream's tip as
full shas, in its output and in the tracking issue, so two commits alike in
their first twelve characters print as two (issue btclib-org/.github#1343).

### `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `ASSURANCE_CASE.md` join the root

The architecture moves there from `CLAUDE.md`, which points at it; the
assurance case cites the tree for every claim (issue
btclib-org/.github#1321).

### The rebuild of a release builds under the release's own uv

`RELEASING.md`'s *Rebuild a release from its tag* builds under the uv
the published wheel names and verifies the sdist first: a wheel that
disagrees stops the chain after it (issue btclib-org/btclib-node#1063).

### The publishing environments' required reviewer is any of the owners

`RELEASING.md` and `REPOSITORY.md` name `fametrano`, `giacomocaironi` and
`pmazzocchi` as the `pypi` and `testpypi` reviewers, not `fametrano` alone
(issue btclib-org/.github#1355).

### `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `README.md` link `GOVERNANCE.md` and `ROADMAP.md`

Both point a contributor at the organization's one copy of each, in
`btclib-org/.github` (issue btclib-org/.github#1359).

### `tests.no_bindings` finds the dispatch from `set_libsecp256k1_serving`

It refuses the bindings held by the module the switch's `__module__` names,
`ellipticcurves.curves.curve` under a btclib re-exporting that switch, and
`no_bindings_anywhere` walks `ellipticcurves` too (closes #52).

### `bip32_test` and `key_wallet_test` find what they patch from a public name

The `mod_sqrt_var` patch and the counted key derivation land in the module
`CurveGroup`'s and `bytes_from_prv_key_int`'s `__module__` names, which
holds under a btclib re-exporting ellipticcurves (closes #55).

### The suite refuses a dispatch switch the installed btclib ignores

`py_arm_authority_test.py`'s measurement sets `BTCLIB_NO_LIBSECP256K1`
and `ELLIPTICCURVES_NO_LIBSECP256K1`; a run with either set while
libsecp256k1 still serves exits 4 rather than measure it (closes #53).

### A refusal of ellipticcurves' own leaves as that package's class

The contract's tests accept its classes beside btclib's, never a bare built-in;
a psbt or `musig()` key it refuses is a `BTClibValueError`, and `bip322.verify`
answers False to its runtime error (closes #54).

### The curve package is `btclib_ecc`

Where the entries above spell it `ellipticcurves`, it is `btclib_ecc`, with
`BTClibEcc*` classes and `BTCLIB_ECC_NO_LIBSECP256K1`; a name btclib leaves
unbound while delegating to it fails the suite (issue btclib-org/btclib#2282).

### `REVIEWING.md` lets a filed issue carry its fix

An issue filed from a review may say the fix where one is known: *What is
filed, and what is not* dropped its "no fix", the filing bar standing as it
was (issue btclib-org/.github#1378).

### A mistyped mnemonic or SLIP-0039 share is no longer echoed whole

`bip39.py`, `electrum.py` and `slip39.py` reported the sentence a caller
handed them in the exception raised over it; each now reports the word
count instead (closes #38).

### `slip39.Share`'s `repr` no longer prints `value`

`value` is the (encrypted) master secret, and the frozen dataclass's
default `repr` printed it; `BIP32KeyData.__repr__` masks its key material
for the same reason (closes #39).

## v2026.9.24

### The wallet layer is a package of its own, `btclib-wallet`

The modules above btclib's primitives leave `btclib` for this package,
each at the same path under `btclib_wallet` (issue btclib-org/btclib#2129).

### `btclib-wallet` imports only btclib's public names

The floor is `btclib>=2026.9.24`, the first btclib release publishing
every name imported here, and the `secp256k1` extra names the bindings
this package imports directly (issue btclib-org/btclib#2242).

### Python 3.11 and up

`requires-python` is `>=3.11`, and the classifiers start at 3.11.

### The interpreters this package claims are the ones it runs on

`tests/interpreters_test.py` refuses a floor, a classifier list and a
platform sweep that disagree on which Pythons this package supports.

### The PSBT, descriptor, BIP32 and BIP322 parsers are fuzzed weekly

`fuzz.yml` runs a ClusterFuzzLite target for each parser that reads a
stranger's octets or text, seeded from the vectors the suite already holds.

### The sdist leaves out the tests that read `.github` or `fuzz/`

Those tests fail when run from an unpacked sdist, which carries neither
directory, and `tests/source_exclude_test.py` refuses one not in
`source-exclude` (closes #1).

### `REPOSITORY.md` records what each read-back answers

Each read-back carries what it answered on 2026-09-24, and the one for the
repository's switches asks for `.default_branch` by its field
(issue btclib-org/btclib#2129).
